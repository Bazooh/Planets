The simplex noise implementation used in this project is based on the work of Jonas Wagner, which itself is an optimization of an algorithm developed by Stefan Gustavson and further improved by Peter Eastman. The rank ordering method enhancement was also introduced by Stefan Gustavson in 2012.

This project also use orbit control to move the chunk around, and dat.gui to easily modify the variables.
